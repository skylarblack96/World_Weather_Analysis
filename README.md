# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a travel route between four cities as well as a marker layer map using the Google Maps Directions API. To accomplish this task we will have the user use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the user will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Based on this information the best travel route will be given between the four different cities to minimize the travel time.
